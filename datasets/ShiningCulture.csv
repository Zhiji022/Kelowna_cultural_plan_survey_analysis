"The Kelowna Art Gallery is very well run and a good <br>example for many other local organizations.

Parks Alive! is <br>a fabulous initiative and probably how the general population gets <br>their 'culture' hit. That said, with it being free, we <br>aren't doing a great job of encouraging people to pay <br>for entertainment or experiences elsewhere. A number of grassroots organizations <br>have popped up over the years and they are working <br>hard to make an impact and find a local audience, <br>creating strong work in the process (New Arts Collective and <br>Fred Skeleton Theatre spring to mind).
