Aug 30 18 02:53:44 pm,25 to 34,Male,"First, the city of Kelowna should increase the size of its <br>cultural services department, through it, it should seek to diversify <br>its team by looking for staff that are racialized or <br>come from marginalized perspectives and staff with an understanding of <br>diversity and truth and reconciliation. Kelowna must also provide grants <br>and funding for its emerging artists coming out of the <br>BFA program at UBC Okanagan. There are really talented folks <br>coming out of there and Kelowna is losing them to <br>bigger cities because of lack of opportunities. It must either <br>provide these through increased funding towards the Alternator, as they <br>are the only non-profit group that addresses this demographic, or <br>it must do so independently. The Arts Council of the <br>Central Okanagan, the Kelowna Arts Council, and the Kelowna Art <br>Gallery have not been successful in engaging its emerging artists <br>demographic. The City of Kelowna should hire competent staff to <br>run its public art department. An understanding of contemporary art <br>and architecture are crucial. Also, knowledge of Truth and Reconciliation <br>is important for this position. As of now there is <br>no Syilx/Indigenous representation in the cultural district. Although Crystal Przybille's <br>works deal with colonization, she is not indigenous and her <br>addressing these topics is problematic. The city of kelowna should <br>make it easier for artists and/or arts organizations to use <br>public space (parks, waterfront, bare walls, etc). It is so <br>difficult and now expensive to even use the courtyard between <br>the RCA and the Kelowna Art Gallery. So much could <br>be happening there. The City of Kelowna should hire someone <br>to re-start the first thursdays program. This person(s) should be <br>in charge of engaging with the cultural district as well <br>as designing and promoting first thursdays in a modern way <br>(ex. have an instagram account, don't just print handbills). A <br>proper budget should be set aside for this.
