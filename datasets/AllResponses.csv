"Dan Ryder its my understanding that in order for the city <br>of Kelowna to give your arts organization funding, you need <br>to be recognized by the city of Kelowna as Professional. <br>To be considered professional artists by the city of Kelowna <br>you need to be a registered non profit organization. So <br>we would have to give away our company and business <br>after 17 years of ups and downs and extremely hard <br>work to a board of directors. Giving away our opportunities <br>for any sort of long term legacy or benefit for <br>all we have invested. Its no secret theres not a <br>ton of money in local theatre. But to face the <br>potential of losing our labour of love so that we <br>can make 20k from the city and pay a non-commercial <br>rate for one booking a year makes no sense to <br>us. or hasnt yet.

"Thanks for the thorough answer, Nathan.

"Dear friends,. I have stumbled across the 2020 - 2025 Culture <br>Plan a little late because I was wanting to offer <br>some culture related feedback today and went to the Kelowna <br>website to see if I could find an appropriate place <br>to make my suggestion. I see that the community consultation <br>phase that has just passed for the 2020 - 2025 <br>Culture Plan, but it seems like this Plan might be <br>a good place for my suggestion to land even if <br>it is a outside the box of the current high-level <br>goals. My suggestion. Every time my husband and I visit <br>Knox Mountain we pause and read the attached sign. We <br>are very grateful to whatever forces made Knox Mountain Park <br>accessible to the public and we imagine that the generosity <br>of the Knox family is among them. But we also <br>express a hope that one day this sign and potentially <br>other historical signs around Kelowna will be updated to reflect <br>some broader context to help the visitor to understand that <br>the history of this place didnt begin with the European <br>settlers. Im curious. What was Knox Mountain called before that? <br>It would be wonderful if the sign told a richer <br>history of that very special place. I think reconciliation or <br>at least some reference to it should be in the <br>top 10 of the 2020-2025 Culture Plan goals. And if <br>its not being undertaken by some other area, perhaps effort <br>toward updating historical signs to reflect a broader, longer, truer <br>history could be considered as one of the actions under <br>this goal.

"First, the city of Kelowna should increase the size of its <br>cultural services department, through it, it should seek to diversify <br>its team by looking for staff that are racialized or <br>come from marginalized perspectives and staff with an understanding of <br>diversity and truth and reconciliation. Kelowna must also provide grants <br>and funding for its emerging artists coming out of the <br>BFA program at UBC Okanagan. There are really talented folks <br>coming out of there and Kelowna is losing them to <br>bigger cities because of lack of opportunities. It must either <br>provide these through increased funding towards the Alternator, as they <br>are the only non-profit group that addresses this demographic, or <br>it must do so independently. The Arts Council of the <br>Central Okanagan, the Kelowna Arts Council, and the Kelowna Art <br>Gallery have not been successful in engaging its emerging artists <br>demographic. The City of Kelowna should hire competent staff to <br>run its public art department. An understanding of contemporary art <br>and architecture are crucial. Also, knowledge of Truth and Reconciliation <br>is important for this position. As of now there is <br>no SyilxIndigenous representation in the cultural district.
